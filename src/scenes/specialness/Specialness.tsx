                        On January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled "Not Alone" as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called Download to Donate for Haiti in support of the Haiti Earthquake crisis.
                        Shinoda designed two T-shirts, in which the proceeds would go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters.
                        In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the "Music for Relief: Concert for the Philippines" in Los Angeles, and raised donations for victims.
