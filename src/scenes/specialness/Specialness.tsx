                        On January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled "Not Alone" as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called Download to Donate for Haiti in support of the Haiti Earthquake crisis.
                        Shinoda designed two T-shirts, in which the proceeds would go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters.
                        In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the "Music for Relief: Concert for the Philippines" in Los Angeles, and raised donations for victims.

You see, I had a tendency on quiting on the last 5 sites I had made, and well I didn't think this was going to last any longer than the rest; </p>
                        <p className="mt-5">As I had just become an active member of the LPMB [Linkin Park Message Board] I incidently recieved my first Private Message from a user known as LinkiedTheory, requesting to help me on my crude experimental site. So, unknown to the dangers of instant recruiting I signed him up with me thinking I've associated myself with some average fan with little or no experience of creating websites, and that I was still on my own.</p>
